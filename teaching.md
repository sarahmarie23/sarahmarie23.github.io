# Together We Learn - My Journey as a Teacher

## Teaching Philosophy

### Introduction

I believe that teaching is not just about imparting knowledge; it’s about empowering students to explore, question, and grow. My own journey in computer science, from starting with no background to becoming a teaching assistant and mentor, has shown me that anyone can succeed with curiosity, determination, and the right guidance.

## Empowering Students Through Exploration and Critical Thinking

>***"Try it and see what happens."***

In my classes, I encourage students to embrace a “try it and see what happens” mindset. When a student asks a question, I suggest we test it out together. This hands-on approach helps students develop confidence in their problem-solving abilities and see mistakes as valuable learning opportunities.

> ***"Go ahead, try to break the code!"***

I frequently ask students thought-provoking questions, such as, “What do you think will happen if I change this part of the code?” or “Why do you think this program might fail?” Sometimes, I even set up scenarios where I expect the code to crash. These moments encourage students to think deeply, analyze their assumptions, and experience those satisfying “aha!” breakthroughs.

## Preparing Students for Real-World Challenges

I focus on teaching concepts that prepare students for professional success, such as writing tests, considering edge cases, and thinking critically about their code. My goal is to ensure they leave my class not only with technical knowledge but also with the tools to tackle complex, real-world problems.

## Creating Engaging and Inclusive Lessons

I strive to make every lesson and assignment engaging by incorporating fun, creative themes that allow students to express themselves. For example, I design projects that feel more like solving puzzles than completing coursework. Rather than simply assigning problems, I often show completed programs to demonstrate concepts, giving students a vision of what they can achieve.

One of my favorite lessons is about classes and objects, when students start working with multiple code files together. I do a Minecraft Day, where we brainstorm a character or creature and have it interact with others. Its always fun because I never know what we will come up with.

## Breaking Down Barriers to Entry  

> ***"You don’t need to be 'good at math' to succeed in computer science. Hard work and determination are what matter."***  

I share my own journey—taking extra math classes and spending countless hours in the tutoring center to catch up—because I want my students to know that computer science is for *everyone*. Whether or not they started coding young, I remind them that success comes from effort, persistence, and belief in their ability to learn.   determination, they can overcome any obstacle and thrive in this field.

## Conclusion

At its core, my teaching philosophy is about creating an inclusive, supportive environment where students feel inspired to learn and empowered to succeed. I teach not just code, but confidence—helping students believe in their ability to solve problems, take risks, and thrive in computer science and beyond.  

## Teaching Experience

My teaching journey began during my time in the Sea Scouts, where I earned the rank of Quartermaster, the program's highest honor (similar to Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts). To achieve this, I spent significant time mentoring less experienced crew members, teaching them essential nautical skills, teamwork, and leadership. This early experience showed me the joy of helping others learn and grow.

Later, I worked as a substitute teacher with the Clark County School District, where I developed classroom management skills and the ability to adapt quickly to different subjects and learning environments.

Now, as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the University of Washington, I guide undergraduate students as they take their first steps into programming. I focus on fostering curiosity, critical thinking, and creativity in the classroom. Whether it’s troubleshooting code together, brainstorming imaginative projects, or celebrating their “aha!” moments, I’m passionate about helping students gain confidence in their skills and see themselves as capable creators.

## Future Goals in Teaching

My long-term goal is to become a full-time lecturer in computer science. However, I believe that gaining industry experience is an essential step toward becoming the best educator I can be. While I plan to explore industry roles to deepen my technical expertise, I am always open to teaching opportunities as they arise. I’m excited to continue growing both as a programmer and a teacher, and I look forward to contributing to any role where I can learn and make an impact.
