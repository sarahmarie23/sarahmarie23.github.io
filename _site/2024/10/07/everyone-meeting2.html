<h2 id="meetings-meetings-meetings">Meetings, Meetings, Meetings</h2>
<p>My individual team meets on Tuesdays, while we have an all-teams meeting on Mondays. I understand that some people don’t like meetings, or think that there are too many (waste of time). But there is merit to having two separate meetings. There is validity to all these meetings <em>as long as time is being spent wisely.</em></p>

<p><em>It is fun seeing the other team’s projects</em> - Some projects have been in development over several quarters, whereas mine is just beginning. It will be cool to see over the course of the next quarters what these projects evolv</p>

<p><em>Sometimes someone brings up a topic that applies to your project</em> - I talked a little about <a href="https://www.covidence.org/">Covidence</a>, a website that helps you process papers for a systematic review. It even creates a PRISMA chart for you that you can use for your paper! Another group is at a stage where they are sorting through sources and trying to keep track of the relevant ones. That, along with <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> have been <strong>game changers</strong>. Zotero is great for personal projects and collaboration. You upload papers yourself <em>or with the plugin, directly from the website where you found the paper!</em></p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Our Monday meetings consist of each student writing a 4x4x4 status report: 4 things you worked on, 4 things you will be working on for next week, 4 things that are blocking you (very Agile!). One of my challenges was communication. We all know how essential communication is, I even bring that up on day one when I teach, and how <em>good</em> communication is essential for many aspects in life. So working on this project is no different. I want to instill better communication between the team because we barely talked and I was wondering what was going on. A daily standup can be effective since you get that face-to-face time every day. Since that is not feasable here and we only have face-to-face once a week, I asked my group to give a small status update on every Friday. But that wasn’t enough. I think I need to initiate conversations more, asking specific questions on what they have tried, so we don’t wait unitl the weekly meeting to find out.</p>
