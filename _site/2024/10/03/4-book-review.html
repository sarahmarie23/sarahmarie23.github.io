<h2 id="general-thoughts">General thoughts</h2>
<p>This book seemed like it was more appropriate for businesses that already had an established product, and were looking to incorporate a mobile app as part of their product. Perhaps I should have focused in on the “for Businesses” instead of the “Mobile App” part of the title. It was published in 2023 so my expectations were higher since it wasn’t that old. Overall this book was broad without going into detail. For me, it was not helpful and talked about topics that didn’t relate, or that I already knew.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-relates-to-the-projecttakeaways">How it relates to the project/takeaways</h2>
<p>Chapters 3 (Create a Mobile App Product Roadmap) and 4 (Balance of Features in Mobile Development) did have some items that I took note of. The MoSCow method for feature prioritization is something I will use in the future. I’ve come across these sort of methods in other sources, so seeing it more than once from a different author reinforces its importance and reminds me of how I can use it.</p>

<p>The book listed some roadmap template tools, which were only free for a trial period. Of course there are others out there and I’m not sure if we need something like that. But just making a note in case it’s something I need at some point. They also mentioned software for wireframes: Axure, Moqups, and Mockplus (pg. 143).</p>

<p>I did like this bubble sort priorizitation from chapter 4, basically keep comparing two features and see which is most important until you have a list in order with the most important features at the top.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I completely lost interest at the part that talked about brainstorming features but didn’t include actually testing with your users. Just “think in the users shoes” and that the QA team will take care of it. I should have stopped earlier and not wasted time that could have been spent reading a more helpful book. Ignore the feeling of needing to be a completionist like reading is some sort of game achievement!</p>
