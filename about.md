# About page

My name is Sarah Martel and I'm currenly a master's student at the University of Washington. I am passionate about programming and working together with others. 

# My Background
I am working on a Master's in Computer Science and Software Engineering degree. Prior to that, I attended Cal Poly Humboldt and earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2023. I wasn't always aiming for a technical career. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2015 at California State University, Long Beach. Today I am greatful that I can combine my dedication to improving mental health and my passion for tech to try and improve the lives of those around me.

During my undergraduate studies, I participated in an REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates). It was my first chance to work on a team with others and publish a paper. Currently, I am working on a project to build an adaptive task and time management phone app that is backed by research to meet the needs of people with ADHD. I am working as a Teaching Assistant at UW, where I plan and carry out engaging activities in Java and C++.

# Skills and Technologies 
My primary programming languages are Kotlin and Java. I have also worked with SQL, Python and C++. Programming is about problem solving. I don't mind learning about something new to get the job done. 

Android is my focus, and I particularly like working with Jetpack Compose.
