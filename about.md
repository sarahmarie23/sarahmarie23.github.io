# About Me

Hi, I'm Sarah Martel, a problem-solver at heart and a firm believer in the power of collaboration. Whether I'm coding an app, mentoring students, or managing a project, I strive to create meaningful solutions that make life a little better for everyone.

# My Journey

My professional path has been anything but linear—starting with a Bachelor’s in Psychology from California State University, Long Beach in 2015, I cultivated a deep understanding of human behavior and mental health. A growing passion for technology led me to pursue a second degree in Computer Science at Cal Poly Humboldt, where I graduated in 2023.

Today, as a Master’s student at the University of Washington, I’m blending my technical expertise with my commitment to teamwork. I’m working on an adaptive task and time management app for people with ADHD—a project fueled by my background in psychology and software engineering.

I’ve also had the privilege of working as a Teaching Assistant, where I lead engaging workshops and mentor students in Java and C++. These experiences have reinforced my passion for education, problem-solving, and fostering collaboration.

# Skills & Technologies

**Programming Languages:** Kotlin, Java, SQL, Python, C++
**Development Focus:** Android Development, Jetpack Compose, adaptive tech for accessibility
**Project Management:** Team leadership, communication, goal-oriented planning, and prioritization
**Research:** User experience design and data-driven solutions

# Outside the Code

When I’m not immersed in programming or mentoring students, you’ll often find me at a sewing machine, piecing together fabric like lines of code. For me, sewing is more than a hobby—it’s a form of problem-solving and creative expression. Each project requires careful planning, precision, and adaptability to bring it to life.

Much like coding, sewing demands an eye for detail, a focus on quality, and the satisfaction of creating something functional and beautiful. Whether it’s crafting costumes or designing everyday wear, I enjoy the challenge of constructing garments that I can actually wear—proof that both creativity and logic can lead to something tangible.

I’m also passionate about geocaching, a game I’ve been playing since 2006. Combining exploration, community, and discovery, geocaching has taught me the thrill of solving puzzles, navigating new terrain, and celebrating the joy of uncovering hidden treasures.
