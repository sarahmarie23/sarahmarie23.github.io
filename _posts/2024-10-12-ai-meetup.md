## What was this event all about?
This was a small gathering (about 20 people) for anyone working with or who has an interest in AI. It was hosted by Seattle AI Society. Everyone went around and introduced themselves and what projects they were working on.

## My thoughts
I have been attending large meetups with 100+ people attending, so it was nice to go to something small for a change. It was exclusively a place to meet and talk with others who share a common interest. I enjoyed hearing other people's stories and getting the chance to share my excitement about my project.

Everyone was friendly and there were a diverse backgrounds. From construction to health care, mental health and education, many fields were represented.

## Would I go again?
Absolutely! I made some meaningful connections and hope to keep in touch. There were people that I wanted to talk to but there's only so much time. Hopefully we will all be back next time.
