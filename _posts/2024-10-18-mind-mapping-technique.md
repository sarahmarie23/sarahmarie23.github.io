# Getting the thoughts out there - using Lucidchart

Aside from this project, I've been on the lookout for an app where I can get my thoughts out and come back to them later. Maybe move them around and make connections. I have random thoughts often about little ideas for the project and just stuff in general. And what always happens is that it just stays in my head until some time later, when I'll go,

### "I just remembered something! I was thinking we could..."

Something like that. Well one of our group members suggested we make a mind map to organize our project's ideas. Now this wasn't in response to my search for a solution, but it inspired in me to try it on a personal level. Because the discussion we had and map we came up with was quite helpful.

## Designing a Map - A collaborative Exercise

We couldn't start making a mind map without knowing what it is we were trying to answer. As a follow-up to Tuesday's meeting where we discussed what's involved in a minimum viable product, I posed today's question as:

### What are the features needed for an MVP?

While we are still working on our emphasize phase, there are features that are pretty certain will be in the app. And since this is just a design exercise, all ideas are encouraged. Here is the mind map we came up with.

This was actually quite fun to make. The colors make it clear the 6 main functionalities we are considering. Of course, we could show the users a design with these implemented and find out what they want. If fact, *they* might not even know what they want! 

The earlier we can start getting this tested, the better. Let's do this!
